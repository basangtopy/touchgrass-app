# TouchGrass: Your Companion to a Better You 🌿

> _Because sometimes the best motivation is having real skin in the game._

## Welcome to TouchGrass

Hey there! 👋

We're glad you're here. TouchGrass isn't just another productivity app—it's your accountability partner that actually _gets_ you. We built it because we're tired of broken promises to ourselves, endless "I'll start tomorrow" loops, and resolutions that fade faster than a New Year's party.

Here's the deal: **you stake real crypto on your goals, prove you did the thing, and get your money back**. Simple. Fair. Effective.

No more empty promises. No more letting yourself off the hook. Just you, your commitment, and a little bit of financial motivation to make sure you follow through.

## The Philosophy: Why TouchGrass Works

### The Psychology of Commitment

Let's have an honest conversation. You _know_ what you should do—exercise more, read more, scroll less, drink more water. But knowing isn't doing. There's always a gap between intention and action.

TouchGrass bridges that gap using a powerful psychological principle called **Loss Aversion**. Studies show we're about twice as motivated to avoid losing something as we are to gain something of equal value. When your actual money is on the line, suddenly that morning run feels a lot more achievable.

But we're not here to punish you. We're here to help you become the person you've always wanted to be.

### What TouchGrass Helps You Achieve

- **🏃 Physical Health** — Get moving! Run, hydrate, hit the gym, touch actual grass. Your body will thank you.
- **🧘 Mental Well-being** — Unplug, meditate, read a book. Give your brain the rest it deserves.
- **⚡ Productivity & Growth** — Build discipline, learn new skills, and watch your life transform.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

First things first—connect your crypto wallet. TouchGrass supports popular wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.

1. Tap the **"Connect Wallet"** button on the home screen
2. Choose your wallet provider
3. Make sure you're on the **Base network** (Coinbase's Layer 2 blockchain)

> 💡 **Why Base?** It's fast, cheap, and backed by Coinbase. Transaction fees are pennies, not dollars.

### Step 2: Get Some Tokens

You'll need either:

- **ETH** (Ether) — The original crypto
- **USDC** (USD Coin) — A stablecoin pegged to the US dollar

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** If you're worried about crypto volatility, go with USDC. Your stake stays worth the same throughout your challenge.

### Set Your Stake

This is where it gets real. Decide:

1. **How much to stake** — The minimum is around $1 USD equivalent. Stake enough that it _means something_ to you.
2. **Which token** — ETH or USDC
3. **What happens if you don't follow through** — More on this in [Understanding Penalty Types](#understanding-penalty-types)

> ⚠️ **The Golden Rule:** Stake enough to feel it, but not so much you'll panic. This should motivate you, not stress you out.

### Lock It In

Take a breath. Then hit that **"I'm In! Lock It 🔒"** button.

You'll sign a blockchain transaction, and your commitment becomes real. Your funds are now locked in a smart contract until you prove completion or time runs out.

No take-backs. No excuses. Just you and your goal.

---

## During Your Challenge

### Your Command Center

Once your challenge is active, you'll see:

- **A beautiful countdown timer** — Your remaining time, updating every second
- **Progress ring** — Visual indicator of time elapsed
- **Your stake details** — What's on the line
- **Motivational quotes** — Rotating wisdom to keep you focused

> _"The discipline you dodge is the growth you lose."_

### Stay Aware of Time

The timer shows:

- **Green** when you have plenty of time
- **Yellow** when you're getting close (1-3 hours remaining)
- **Red** when it's urgent (less than 1 hour)

Tap the timer to see the exact end time (e.g., "Tomorrow 3:45 PM").

### Quick Tip: Don't Wait Until the Last Minute

Prove your challenge early! Things happen—phones die, life gets busy. Give yourself a buffer.

## Proving You Did It

### How Verification Works

When you've completed your goal, it's time to prove it:

1. Tap **"Done! Submit Proof"** from your active challenge
2. Upload a clear photo showing you completed the task
3. Our AI reviews your evidence
4. If verified, your success is recorded on the blockchain!

### What Counts as Good Proof?

The AI is smart, but it needs _clear evidence_. Here's what works:

| Goal            | Great Proof                           | Not-So-Great Proof              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Run 5km         | Watch showing 5.01km                  | Photo of running shoes          |
| Read 50 Pages   | Open book with current page visible   | Closed book on a table          |
| No Social Media | Screen Time showing 0 minutes on apps | Just saying you didn't use them |
| Gym Workout     | Gym selfie or machine stats           | Photo of gym bag                |
| Drink 3L Water  | Water tracker app or empty bottles    | A water bottle                  |

### Tips for Successful Verification

- **Be literal** — If the goal says "Run 5km," show the distance metric
- **Good lighting** — Don't make the AI squint
- **Relevant content** — Show what you achieved, not your setup
- **Numbers matter** — For metric-based goals, visible data is key

### If the AI Says No

Don't panic! You can submit again as many times as needed before the deadline. Just try a clearer photo with better evidence.

## When You Win

### 🎉 Congratulations!

You did it! When you successfully verify your challenge, you'll be greeted with confetti and a victory celebration (you earned it).

### Withdrawing Your Funds

Your staked crypto is now unlocked. Hit **"Withdraw Funds"** to get it back.

### Pay It Forward (Optional)

Feeling generous? You can donate a portion of your stake to charity or to support TouchGrass development before withdrawing. Use the slider to set your percentage—every little bit helps.

### Mint Your Victory NFT 🏆

Prove your accomplishment forever by minting a **"Proof of Victory" NFT**. It's a digital badge that lives on the blockchain, showing the world (and your future self) that you followed through.

### Share Your Win

Generate a shareable image of your challenge stats and brag about it! Post to social media, send to friends, or just save it for yourself.

## When Things Don't Go as Planned

Hey, it happens. Life gets in the way sometimes. Here's what to expect if you don't verify in time.

### The Penalty Kicks In

Whatever penalty type you chose during setup now executes. But remember:

- If you chose **Charity**, your stake helps fund public health causes
- If you chose **Lock**, you'll just have to wait to get your money back
- If you chose **Dev Support**, you're helping improve TouchGrass
- If you chose **Burn**... well, that's gone forever

### Resolving a Failed Challenge

Depending on your penalty type:

- **Partial Donation:** Click "Settle & Withdraw Remainder" to split the stake
- **Full Donation/Burn:** Click "Accept the Loss & Close"
- **Lock:** Wait out the penance timer, then click "Claim Unlocked Funds"

### It's a Learning Experience

Even a failed challenge teaches you something. Maybe you set the bar too high, chose the wrong timeframe, or life threw you a curveball. Adjust and try again. Every setback is a setup for a comeback.

---

## Understanding Penalty Types

When you create a challenge, you choose what happens if you don't follow through. Choose wisely—this is your accountability mechanism.

### 💚 Give to Health Charity

Your stake is donated to public health causes. Your failure becomes someone else's gain. It's the "feel-good" penalty.

**Best for:** People who want a safety net of meaning. If you fail, at least you did some good.

### 🛠️ Support the Dev Team

Your stake goes to the TouchGrass treasury to fund ongoing development and improvements.

**Best for:** Those who believe in the project and want to contribute either way.

### 🔐 Timeout Mode (Lock)

No money is lost, but your funds are frozen for **5x your original challenge duration**. Failed a 24-hour challenge? Your funds are locked for 5 days.

**Best for:** Those who want accountability without financial loss. Time is money, after all.

### 🔥 Burn It All

Your stake is sent to a dead address and destroyed forever. Nobody gets it. Maximum stakes, maximum motivation.

**Best for:** The hardcore. Those who need the ultimate "there's no way I'm not doing this" motivation.

### Adjustable Penalty Percentage

For Charity and Dev penalties, you can adjust what percentage of your stake is at risk (20-100%). The rest comes back to you even if you fail.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Is my money actually safe?"

**Yes.** TouchGrass is non-custodial. Your funds sit in a smart contract on the blockchain, not in someone's bank account. The code dictates exactly when and how funds can move. Neither developers nor anyone else can touch your stake—only you (after meeting the conditions).

### "What if my challenge disappears from my dashboard?"

Sit tight for about 30 seconds. TouchGrass has an Auto-Recovery system that scans the blockchain for your challenges and restores them automatically. Your funds are never lost.

### "Can I submit unlimited verification attempts?"

Yes! Submit as many times as you need before your deadline. Just make sure each photo clearly shows your accomplishment.

### "Why does it say 'Recovered Challenge' on my dashboard?"

That means we restored a challenge from the blockchain, but we couldn't recover its original title. Just tap the pencil icon to rename it.

### "I verified successfully but can't withdraw—what's wrong?"

You probably need a tiny bit of ETH for gas fees. Make sure your wallet has some ETH (even $0.10 is usually enough on Base).

### "Can I cancel a challenge after I start it?"

No. Once you lock your stake, you're committed. That's the whole point! The only way out is to complete the challenge or wait for the penalty.

## Tips for Success

### Start Small

Your first challenge doesn't need to be "Run a Marathon." Try "Walk 15 Minutes" or "Read 10 Pages." Build confidence, then scale up.

### Be Specific

"Get Healthier" is vague. "Walk 5000 Steps" is measurable. Choose or create goals with clear success criteria.

### Set Realistic Timeframes

Don't give yourself 2 hours to complete a task that realistically takes 4. Be honest with yourself about what you can achieve.

### Stake Meaningfully

$1 probably won't motivate you. $100 might stress you out. Find your sweet spot—the amount that makes you _want_ to succeed without causing anxiety.

### Use the Lock Penalty for Learning

New to TouchGrass? The Lock penalty is forgiving. You won't lose money, just time. Use it while you calibrate what works for you.

### Complete and Verify Early

Don't wait until 5 minutes before the deadline. Phones die, internet goes down, life happens. Give yourself a buffer.

### Celebrate Your Wins

Mint that NFT. Share that success. You did something most people can't—you followed through on a commitment to yourself. That's worth celebrating.

## Your Journey Starts Now

TouchGrass isn't magic. It won't do the work for you. But it will give you the one thing most people lack: **a reason to show up when you don't feel like it**.

Every challenge you complete, every goal you crush, every time you prove yourself right—you're building something more valuable than money. You're building the person you want to become.

So go ahead. Pick a goal. Put something on the line.

We believe in you. 💪🌿
